### IRB-HSR 21333
Clinic Visit Registration:
21333- Diduch

##  Inclusion Criteria

- Male or female age 25-65 at time of screening
- Body Mass Index < 35 (BMI=kg/m2)
- Weight <300lbs (or 136kg)
- Pain in study knee as demonstrated by a minimum score of 40 (Scale 0-100) on the WOMAC pain questions in KOOS
- Knee flexion >90⁰ and <140⁰
- Clinical symptoms (such as pain primarily localized to the medial aspect of the study knee and generally exacerbated by weight bearing) and radiographic evidence, using a weight-bearing fixed flexion view, of osteoarthritis in the study knee as defined as KL grade of 1-4
- Failed at least 6 months of non-operative treatment with continued OA Pain with at least one of these interventions as per the AAOS Treatment of OA of the Knee

##  Exclusion Criteria

- Radiographic evidence of large, defined as > Grade 2, marginal osteophytes in the medial compartment of the study knee
- Bony erosion
- Clinical symptoms or radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in the:
  - Lateral compartment of the study knee defined as KL grade of >2
  - Patellofemoral compartment of the study knee defined as KL grade of >3
- Clinical symptoms or radiographic evidence of OA at the contralateral knee that would preclude activity of daily living, stair climbing, stair descending, or that requires the use of an assist device
- Mechanical axis alignment (Hip-Knee-Ankle) <-16⁰ (varus) or >0⁰ (valgus) OR anatomic axis alignment <-10⁰ (varus) or >6⁰ (valgus) as measured on a Long-Standing AP X-ray view
- Hyperextension >5⁰
- Flexion contracture >10⁰
- Insufficiency of the cruciate and collateral ligaments, which would preclude stability of the Calypso Knee System
- Pathologic ligamentous (Lachman>1) or meniscal instability
- Previous knee surgeries:
  - Lateral meniscectomy, patellar surgery, osteotomy, prior knee implant or knee joint replacement of the study knee
  - Joint modifying surgery in the study knee within 12 months of index procedure (e.g., ligament reconstruction, meniscus repair, cartilage transplantation, microfracture, etc.)
  - Arthroscopic surgeries in the study knee within 3 months of index procedure for joint lavage, meniscectomy, chondral debridement, and loose body removal
- Active infection, sepsis, osteomyelitis or history of septic arthritis in any joint
- Rheumatoid arthritis, other forms of inflammatory joint disease or autoimmune disorder
- Paget’s disease or metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation
- Osteomalacia or osteonecrosis (known or suspected)
- Known or suspected rapidly destructive OA (RDO) as determined by the investigator
- Charcot’s joint disease
- Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST) score of < 4 for women or < 6 for men AND a T-score less than -1.0 based on a DEXA scan of the proximal femur (preferred) or lumbar spine. All subjects with an OST score < 4 for women or < 6 for men will undergo a DEXA scan to determine the bone mineral density T-score
- Steroid treatment (oral or IV), medication use that affects bone metabolism (such as chemotherapy) or radiotherapy within 6 months of index procedure
- Bone malignancy (active or history)
- Allergy or hypersensitivity to cobalt, chromium, iron, or nickel metals (suspected or documented)
- Life expectancy estimated to be less than 5 years (i.e., malignancies, end-stage liver, kidney, cardiac failure)
- Comorbidities that could impact study participation or results:
  - Neurological disorders affecting gait
  - Neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome or Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) or pain requiring chronic pain management
  - Severe neurosensory deficits, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease
  - Immunologically suppressed or immunocompromised patients such as HIV
  - Diabetes mellitus requiring daily insulin therapy
  - Radicular symptoms associated with lumbar spine pathology
  - Significant psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia)
  - Substance and alcohol dependence and abuse (meeting standard diagnostic criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV)
- Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant
- Subjects unable to give voluntary written informed consent to participate
- Subjects who are currently involved in any investigational drug or device trial or have been enrolled in such trials within 3 months of index procedure
- Other factors that the investigator feels would interfere with the participation and completion of the study such as:
  - Unable to understand the clinical investigation or cooperate with investigational procedures
  - Planned relocation or unable to return for required follow-up visits
  - Active litigation for musculoskeletal injuries or disorders
  - Active workers compensation or Labor & Industries claim for musculoskeletal injury or disorder
