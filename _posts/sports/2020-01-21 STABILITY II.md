### HSR# 200234

##  Inclusion Criteria

- The patient has an ACL- deficient knee
- The patient is skeletally mature; i.e., epiphyseal growth plates are closed: if no, we need to upload the AP and Lateral View Radiographs
- Two or more of the following criteria are true for the patient:
	- The patient competes in a competitive pivoting sport
	- The patient has generalized ligamentous laxity (i.e., Beighton score of 4 or greater)
	- The patient has a pivot shift of 2 or greater
	- The patient has a genu recruvatum of more than 10 degrees

##  Exclusion Criteria

- The patient is younger than 14 or older than 25 years of age
-  The patient has undergone previous ACL reconstruction of either knee
- The patient requires repair or reconstruction of the PCL, MCL, or LCL
- The patient has a symptomatic articular cartilage defect that requires treatment other than debridement
- The patient has a past/present history of inflammatory arthritis, metabolic bone, collagen, degenerative joint, or neoplastic disease
- The patient has a femoral, tibial, or patellar fracture (other than Segond fractures)
- The patient has an asymmetric varus or valgus greater than 3 degrees
- The patient has a debilitating (per discretion of the treating surgeon) anterior knee pain that would preclude the use of QT or BPTB tissue as a graft
- The patient has significant (per discretion of the treating surgeon) patellar or quad tendon tendonitis that would preclude the use of that tissue as a graft
- The patient has a cognitive impairment or psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent OR renders the patient unable to complete questionnaires
- The patient has no fixed address or means of contact
- The patient has a major medical illness where life expectancy is less than 2 years
- The patient is pregnant
- The patient is not available for follow-up at specified time periods of before surgery, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months post surgery
- Other (per discretion of the surgeon)

## Study Summary

- Screening: Baseline questionnaires, clinical exam (pivot shift and ROM)
- Surgery: Randomization will be done in the OR after completing inta-operative inclusion/exclusion review. Randomization groups:
	- ACLR with QT
	- ACLR with QT and LET
	- ACLR with BPTB
	- ACLR with BPTB and LET
- Clinical Follow-Ups:
	- 6 weeks, 3months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months 
	- All visits will include ROM (by blinded assessor), pivot shift, PROs
	- Standing flexion x-ray at 24 month visit
- STEP/LEAP Follow-Ups:
	- 6 month, 12 month and 24 months
	- Muscle strength by biodex or dynamometer- 6, 12, and 24mo
	- Functional Hop Series- 6, 12, and 24mo
	- Drop Vertical Jump- 6 and 12 month

## Payment:
- Baseline: $50
- 6-week PROs: $20
- 12-week PROs: $20
- 6-month: $50 ($25 for visit and PROs, $25 for LEAP test)
- 12 month: $50 ($25 for visit and PROs, $25 for LEAP test)
- 24 month: $50 ($25 for visit and PROs, $25 for LEAP test)
-*Incentive payment: if a subject completes all components of the 6, 12, and 24 month visits, they get an extra $50
