- Has experienced pain in study knee for at least 3 months
- Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1-3 Osteoarthritis in the study knee
  - Grade 0: no radiographic features of OA are present
  - Grade 1: doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping
  - Grade 2: definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph
  - Grade 3: multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity
  - Grade 4: large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity with complete loss of joint space (bone-on-bone) or subchondral bone collapse
- BML is confirmed on T2 weighted or Proton Density MR Imaging by presence of white signal
- Single BML of tibia, single BML of femur, or adjoining BML’s of tibia & femur extending to the articular surface of the joint
- Surgical candidate for knee arthroscopy due to mechanical symptoms, meniscus tear, loose body and/or synovitis
- Must record a response, at the preoperative study visit, of moderate to extreme pain for any one of the KOOS Pain Scale questions, P2 through P9
- Index knee alignment is defined radiographically as one of the following: Neutral, ≤ 6° mechanical varus, or ≤ 6° mechanical valgus
- Ligaments in the study knee are stable
- The contralateral (non-study) knee is stable and functional
- Is refractory to conservative non-surgical management
  - having failed 2 or more of the following: hyaluronic acid injection, corticosteroid injection, NSAIDs, physical therapy, bracing, activity modification, or minimal surgical intervention (e.g., arthroscopy, debridement/chondroplasty, and/or loose body removal)
  - and is ≥ 3 months from the start of treatment
- Must be physically and mentally willing and able, in the Investigator’s opinion at the time of enrollment, to be compliant with the protocol - including all follow-up visits, survey completion, weight-bearing restrictions, and post-operative rehabilitation

##  Exclusion Criteria

- BML caused by acute trauma less than 3 months prior to enrollment 
- Clinical and/or radiographic disease diagnosis of the index knee that includes any of the following
  - Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 4 Osteoarthritis, with complete loss of joint space (bone-on-bone) or subchondral bone collapse
  - Rheumatoid arthritis, or history of septic or reactive arthritis
  - Gout or a history of gout or pseudogout in the affected knee

- Passive knee flexion < 110° or flexion contracture >30°,
- History of secondary arthropathies (i.e., sickle cell disease, hemochromatosis, or autoimmune disease)
- Has a neuromuscular, neurosensory, or musculoskeletal deficiency that limits the ability to perform objective functional assessment of either knee
- If diabetic, blood glucose over 200 mg/dL at time of enrollment
- Current smoker or < 3months from smoking cessation
- Presents a high surgical risk due to unstable cardiac and/or pulmonary disease
- Has HIV or other immunodeficient state including subjects on immunosuppressant therapies, or has significant illness (metastasis of any type) that decreases the probability of survival to the 2 year endpoint
- Is at substantial risk for the need of organ transplantation, such as renal insufficiency
- Is pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of surgery
- Has a history of any invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer), unless treated with curative intent and with no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for 5 years

- Anticipates having a lower extremity surgery other than the investigational surgery during the course of the study
- Is participating concurrently in another clinical trial, or has participated in a clinical trial within 30 days of surgery
- Is receiving prescription pain medication other than NSAIDs or acetaminophen for conditions unrelated to the index knee condition, chronic use of anticoagulants, or taking corticosteroids
- Active joint infection or history of chronic joint infection at the surgical site
- Prior total meniscectomy of index knee
- Has primarily patellofemoral symptoms
- Is indicated for concomitant procedures (i.e., microfracture, subchondral drilling, cartilage allograft, ligament or tendon repair, distal realignment/osteotomy) in the index knee, with the exception of incidental loose body removal, debridement, synovectomy, osteophyte removal in locations other than adjacent to BMLs, and/or partial meniscectomy
- Has contraindications for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
- Is receiving worker’s compensation or is currently involved in litigation relating to the index knee
