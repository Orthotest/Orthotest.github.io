### IRB-HSR 19012
Clinic Visit Registration:
19012-Weiss

##  Inclusion Criteria
- All “high energy” tibial plateau fractures treated operatively with plate and screw fixation.
- We define “high energy” tibial plateau fractures as patients who are either:
- Initially treated with an external fixation (with or without limited internal fixation) and treated definitively more than 3 days later after swelling has resolved.
- Any open type I, II, or IIIA fracture, regardless of timing of definitive treatment.
- Any tibial plateau fracture associated with ipsilateral leg compartment syndrome fasciotomy wounds.
- All “high energy” pilon (distal tibial plafond) fractures treated operatively with plate and screw fixation. We define “high energy” pilon fractures as patients who are either:
- Initially treated with an external fixation (with or without fibula fixation or limited internal fixation) and treated definitively more than 3 days later after swelling has resolved.
- Any open type I, II, or IIIA fracture, regardless of timing of definitive treatment.
- Any tibial pilon fracture associated with ipsilateral leg compartment syndrome fasciotomy wounds.
- Ages 18 to 80 years
- Patients may have co-existing non-tibial infection, with or without antibiotic treatment.
- Patients may have risk factors for infection including diabetes, immunosuppression from steroids or other medications, HIV, or other infections.
- Patients may have a head injury
- Patients may have a portion of the fixation (e.g. fibula fixation in pilon or percutaneous screws across a tibial plateau fracture) prior to definitive plate fixation, at the initial surgery before randomization.
- Patients may have other orthopedic and non-orthopaedic injuries.
- Patients may have pre-existing musculoskeletal injuries, be non ambulators, or have spinal cord injuries.
- Women and minorities are included.

##  Exclusion Criteria

- The study injury: tibial plateau, pilon, is already infected at time of study enrollment.
- Patient speaks neither English nor Spanish.
