Clinic Visit Registration:
21416-Weiss

## Inclusion Criteria

- Adults ages 18-55 inclusive
- Admitted for operative treatment of closed diaphyseal femur fracture with one of the following OTA codes: 32A, 32B, or 32C (treated with an IM Nail)


## Exclusion Criteria

- Open diaphyseal femur fracture (except low velocity gunshot wounds) or severe crushing injuries to study limb
- Additional fracture, dislocations or soft tissue injuries to the study limb that would compromise the ability to weight bear as tolerated and begin PT within 28-42 days of the definitive fixation.
- Any fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injuries to the contralateral limb or pelvis that would compromise the ability to weight bear as tolerated and begin PT within 28-42 days of the definitive fixation.
- Any treatment of the study injury in either group that would preclude application of the tourniquet cuff (e.g. vascular reconstruction, wound, flap, or skin graft).
- Injuries to other body systems (or other medical conditions) that would preclude the ability to weight bear as tolerated and begin PT within 28-42 days of the definitive fixation (e.g. spinal cord deficit; severe traumatic brain injury)
- Use of blood flow restriction (BFR) at any time between treatment and the start of PT for the study
- Non-ambulatory pre-injury
- Morbidly obese (BMI >40)
- History of peripheral artery disease and/or peripheral vascular disease (PAD/PVD)

## Study Summary

A Multicenter randomized controlled trial

To test the effectiveness of the REPAIR intervention (physical therapy (PT) plus blood flow restricted (BFR) training) when compared to usual care PT alone.  We hypothesize that REPAIR will lead to improved long-term functional outcomes, largely through its effect on increasing muscle strength and muscle volume.
