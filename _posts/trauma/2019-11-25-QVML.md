 ## Study Summary
 
 The research is trying to measure muscle function in patients with muscle tissue loss from traumatic injuries. We will compare information and images obtained in people with lower extremity injury with people who do not have any injury.
 
 The present study aims to function as a pilot study to compare the functional and radiographic deficits between a normal population (IRB-HSR 18918) and the VML injured population. With the information gained we plan to identify the differences in populations to hopefully develop new treatment protocols and technologies for VML injuries. Participants will undergo study procedures such as functional testing, MRI scan, Zebrascope, & Ultrasound testing used to quantify VML variables. Their participation in the research is complete once all testing is complete. After all of the data is collected a Wilcoxon test will be performed on each variable to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between groups. These pilot study results will be utilized to apply for a larger grant, and the next steps will be to perform this study on a larger sample size
