 ## Study Summary
 
 Multi-center study funded by
 
 The present study aims to function as a pilot study to compare the functional and radiographic deficits between a normal population (IRB-HSR 18918) and the VML injured population. With the information gained we plan to identify the differences in populations to hopefully develop new treatment protocols and technologies for VML injuries. Participants will undergo study procedures such as functional testing, MRI scan, Zebrascope, & Ultrasound testing used to quantify VML variables. Their participation in the research is complete once all testing is complete. After all of the data is collected a Wilcoxon test will be performed on each variable to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between groups. These pilot study results will be utilized to apply for a larger grant, and the next steps will be to perform this study on a larger sample size
